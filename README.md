# ImageProcessingUsingML
# Brick Sound Quality Evaluation

This project analyzes audio recordings of brick sounds to determine their quality—whether they resemble metal (high-quality) or cardboard (low-quality) when struck together. It utilizes spectrogram analysis to visualize and evaluate the sound characteristics.

## Features

•⁠  ⁠Audio processing using Librosa for spectrogram computation
•⁠  ⁠Quality evaluation based on spectrogram intensity
•⁠  ⁠Visual representation of spectrograms and evaluation results
•⁠  ⁠Display of evaluation results on a custom dot matrix display

# Tower of Hanoi Dot Matrix Display

This project calculates the number of steps required to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle for a given number of disks and displays the result on a custom-width dot matrix display. The display mimics LED sea markers and uses a circular disc for each dot. The project also includes a bonus section for solving the Cyclic Hanoi puzzle.

## Features

•⁠  ⁠Calculate steps to solve Tower of Hanoi
•⁠  ⁠Generate dot matrix display for visual representation
•⁠  ⁠Support for grayscale dot matrix images
